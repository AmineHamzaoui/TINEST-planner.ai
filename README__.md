## Dataset approach
To address the problem, we initially approached it by simulating and experimenting with a dataset that was gathered through research and synthetically created. Our focus was on analyzing employees
their tasks (such as the duration of each task), and various operational factors like the gate’s location, including entry points and areas within the premises.
We dynamically extracted information on employee locations, skills, and their automatic classification.
The primary objective of our approach is to minimize downtime and enhance the efficiency of work order scheduling.

## AI database agent
The project involves utilizing an SQLite database to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. In this approach, a generative AI will assist in translating natural language queries into SQL code, enabling a seamless interaction between users and the database. The outcome will be the development of a database agent that leverages AI to understand and convert user requests into precise SQL commands, making data retrieval more intuitive and accessible.
